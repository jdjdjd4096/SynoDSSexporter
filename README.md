# About the script 
Synology .DSS file exporter is a simple command line tool to extract info about stored configuration in a file generated by Synology device ended with extension .dss. DSS files are not simple and fast readable by humans. Purpose of this script is to help generate documentation fast, easy and readable by humans. Not every time the user wants to use the automatic recovery configuration procedure. Comparison of manually re-created configuration comparable to previous settings is more expected by users. Unfortunately any Synology application delivered by the venor not allowed to simply do this task. Sometimes users want to take a look at what is stored inside the file before giving it to someone, or make a decision to use it for the final recovery process. 

# Inspiration for this script 
Inspiration for this script was found on the Internet [page](https://gist.github.com/willfurnass/7db2a26a7a147cc8b86676651e1ab8c1) with a short unpack methodology from Linux.

# TLTR - all technical details 
Is obvious that behind this script and especially the .DSS file is hidden a huge portion of the knowledge, so placing it exactly in this README.md file is not a good idea.
Below you find all information written during creating this tool and analyse the .DSS contents.
- How to generate .DSS file using Synology device 
- .DSS [archive file](/doc/DSSarchiveFileStruct.md) structure 
- .DSS [unpacked repository](/doc/DSSarchiveFileStruct.md) and theirs elements structure 
- [_Syno_ConfBkp.db](/doc/_Syno_ConfBkp.db.md) SQLite database 

# How to run the script 
This basic version of the script is written in Windows Powershell, when this script will be fully functional, other languages or platforms might be created in the future.
Please download this code, save it in the same folder where .DSS files are placed.
Then run the script adding only as parameter the full .DSS filename that stores the configuration, downloaded from synology device NAS. 
# Prerequisities needed to run the script 
- before run the downloaded scripts (mainly SQLite modules)
- check that module PSSQLite is installed

# Script Output 
Script output is simple as it can at this stage of the development.
Console dumps only messages about the running process, all extracted final data are stored in two files. 
- FileWithResult.txt
- RAW_data_from_hash.txt
At this moment useful is only the second file.

# ToDo 
- full readable dump into HTML file 
- interoperable script usable on different OS platforms. 
- security - expose which sesitive informations .DSS file holds when we make this file public. 

# if you really want to help develop this tool 
Don't hesitate and please contact me. I'm open to collaboration on this simple thing.
