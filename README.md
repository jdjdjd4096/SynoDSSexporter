# SynoDSSexporter
Synology DSS file exporter is a simple command line tool to extract info about stored configuration in file generated by Synology device ended with extension .dss.
DSS file is not suimply and fast readable by humans. Purpose of this script is to help generate simple documentaionwhich information are stored in this file. Not everytime the automatic recovery configuration process for synology device is possible or as a aim, thus comparation of manualy re-created configuration comparable to previous settings is more expected by users. Unfortunately any Synology app delivered by the venor not allow to simply todo this task. 

# How to obtain configuration backup file from Synology device ? 
Synology explains very detail about this process on their help. If you don't know how generate this file automatically/manually please read this part of the help

# DS File structure 
The file structure is not simple in first eye sight, because this file is as archive compressed twicely. 
 
 First test of the .dss file returns: 
  
**>"C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" l dsm0_20211006.dss**

 So, we have in this archive one file. Let's extract it. 
 
 **"C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" e dsm0_20211006.dss**
 
 After this process we have unpacked file. But this is not destination file that holds whole Synology device backup. 
 Let's try to test this unpacked file again. 
 
 **"C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" l dsm0_20211006**

Next step is simple to extract this file. Please use the switch x. This switch extract this content above to one folder called ConfigBkp.
 **"C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" x dsm0_20211006**
